# Project Title

Stochastic Treatment Regimes in Climate-Health Research: Reassessing Malaria Risk Under Warming Scenarios in Colombia

## Description

Dataset and code shared to reproduce the paper's results "Stochastic Treatment Regimes in Climate-Health Research: Reassessing Malaria Risk Under Warming Scenarios in Colombia". 
The appropriate adjustment can be obtained with the file DAG_analysis.R.
The causal exposure-response curve of the effect of temperature on the incidence of malaria can be obtained with the file exposure_response_curve.py.
The regimenes analysis can be obtained with the file regimenes_temperature.R.
